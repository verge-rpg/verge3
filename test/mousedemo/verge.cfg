# verge.cfg
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# This file controls how Verge3 starts up. For your games, play
# around with the settings until they please you. Be careful
# tampering with any verge.cfg included with someone else's game;
# as you'll see, there are some very game-specific directives in
# here.
# 
# If you don't want to worry about it, this file is a pretty
# nice default.
#
# Comment lines start with #. All other lines are config
# directives. As you can see, I am long winded.

# Release mode is when your game is finished all pretty-like and
# you don't want players to wait around for Verge to compile it
# when they run it. Only turn this on when you're not doing any
# more coding with this copy. And be nice and release a mac
# version too, if you can; the compiled games are not cross-
# platform.
#releasemode 1

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Some debugging directives. For optimum programming help,
# uncomment both of these. vcverbose being on will generate a
# file called vccverbose.txt when compilation takes place,
# and will contain a bunch of stats on the compilation. editcode
# will spawn a second window when Verge runs, in which you will
# be able to dynamically reload source code and test things.

# gamerate controls how fast the game "thinks". Normally this is
# a rate of 100 - that means that the global variable timer
# increments 100 times a second. Setting this to something could
# let you achieve various effects, but be warned that the timing
# of EVERYTHING, including entity movement and animation, is
# affected by this. Unless you're really sure you need to change
# this, try not to. Or just leave it commented out.
