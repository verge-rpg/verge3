[16:22] <vec\dev> oh crap. maped needs some way to display the current tile NUMBER selected!

 * clicking on an entity (when in entity mode) would open the editor for that entity
 * and click somewhere where there is no entity would place one there
 * add obstruction tile importing

PLUGIN SYSTEM:

 * Implement the Brush Properties tab. The Brush/properties tab layout is fine 
   the way it is - the properties dont need to be visible at all times, thats
   how its done in photoshop
 * In addition to the existing plugins, a map Copy/Paste plugin needs to be 
   created. There should be both a single-layer copy mode, as well as an
   all-layer copy mode.
 * Some doc needs to be made, which can be kind of terse and technical, that
   explains how you can make a plugin

GENERAL:
 * Ability to use arrow keys to scroll the map ?
 * Tile Animations - drawing on the map, as well as the ability to edit
   the animations themselves in the vsp. The actual rendering of animations
   should probably be a toggle, for people with slow computers that dont want the
   map constantly redrawing? or maybe it is already sort of.
 * Map parallaxing. There needs to be some way to preview how the 
   parallaxing will look. Whether it be a "launch verge in mapviewer mode at xx res"
   button or a built in scroller that works at a given resolution.. Idunno.
   In general, a "launch map in engine" button, or just "launch engine" button
   wouldnt be a bad thing to have. But maybe it should be in VergeIDE instead. idunno
 * Tiled, however, IMO, this should be a low priority at this point. It should be one 
   of the last things done. Obviously its important, but the engine can be basically
   fully completed without it. The same isnt true of, say, entities. ^_^

MENUS:
 * Where there is Undo, there should ideally be Redo. I dont know how your undo system
   is setup, but Redo really shouldn't be too hard to do. Any time a new edit is made,
   the Redo list is cleared. An action can only be redone directly after an Undo.
 * Zone Editor:

    - POSSIBLY, a little Edit Script button that would pop up the awesome syntax highlighting 
      RTF editor and display the VC for that script. that would own

 * There should be an actual Help section under the Help menu, which would launch the aforementioned
   HTML help.



/*******  STUFF BELOW THIS LINE HAS BEEN FINISHED   **********/

 * make eyedropper work on all layer types
 * add Delete Entity/Zone
 * add autoexec script functionality
 * fix numeric up/downs in ent wander forms
 * make sidebar ent/zone lists double-clickable
PLUGIN SYSTEM:
 * Remove the bottom Plugins section of the screen
 * The plugin system will probably have to be modified some way to 
   include an icon for the new Brush picker?
 * It is extremely important that the "Brush" plugin be activated by default.

GENERAL:
 * The Layer tool and the Tiles tool should really be visible at the
   same time. Some compression of the right-bar area might be needed to
   fit everything. the Brush/properties tab area can probably be vertically
   shrunk a bit
 * Entities is a big one obviously
 * File associations. Map/Vsp filetype icons. Double-clicking a map launches maped. etc.
 * Updated obstruction editing - in whatever form that is decided upon
 * Zone editing (on map)

MENUS:
 * New Map functionality. Should pop up a dialog. You probably know what should
   be in the dialog, but we can hammer out details if you need.
 * Zone Editor:
    - Add Listview on the side of zones that you can click on.
    - Event should be a String. EntityEvent should be removed, for now.
    - There should be a way to allocate a new zone from within that zone editor dialog.
    - I think you may need to increase the ComboBox number of options listed thingy or something.
      I think it defaults to a cap of 100, but it can be changed. I THINK.
    - In the Map menu, the Zones -> submenu should either have more options added to it, or it 
      should be removed and the Edit Zones menu moved to the root Map menu. In either case, the
      button should also be hook up (it doesnt fire any event right now).
    - I would put a little LinkLabel control at the bottom/right corner or something titled "Help".
      Maped3 should have a help system. I think we will just use HTML help. So the link label only
      has to have code to open up a url, which is easy in .NET. Ask me if you need code. We can 
      worry about actually making the help HTML later. But it would be nice to explain what the
      different options are. Thats the difference between Us and Them.
 * Map Properties dialog should have a way to set the starting location, and the renderstring.
   Probably some other things that are currently slipping my mind.
 * There needs to be a status bar line (looks like there is one already, but it needs to have 
   stuff in it) - namely, the x/y location that the mouse is currently over should be displayed.
   Thats pretty important ^_^
 * There needs to be an Edit Layer dialog as well which edits the properties for the layer, such
   as Transparency.
 * Additionally, there should be Help linklabels that I mentioned before in the Map Properties dialog, 
   the Layer Edit dialog, the Entity edit dialog box, and TileEd.
