1:53 am -- moderate asskickage! not really, though. too distracted! so i turn in early so that i might dominate maped tomorrow
- added export/import from clipboard (zeromus gets cred for the clipboard manager code)
- double clicking on zone layer spawns zone editor, and same for entities
- added wander delay, and autoface variables to the entiity editor and map format. map format is now solidified for release, i think.
- updated the menus with all the shortcuts i could think of
- if a file in the mru list is no longer there, clicking on it will remove it now
- deleted some unused menu items, added some others. like 'Help' which doesnt do anything yet

---------
4:22 am -- sufficient asskickage for a single night. less than i planned on but asskickage nonetheless. weekend of asskicking ahead!
- added an opacity slider to the layer control
- minimap will now preserve the ratio of a map. Won't get scaling issues on non-square maps (see BUMVILLE.map)
- added toolbar to the layer view.  will be used to change layer order, delete, and add layers
- added Run Map button, but it doesn't really work. (I'm lacking an update engine binary)
- fixed bug in entity editor that sometimes changes were getting lost
- eyedropper now works on all layer types
- renamed AutoExec script to Startup Script(that was an enormous amount of work. it belongs in this list!!)
- put the finishing touches on the colorpickers for TileEd
- TileEd's layout is basically -established-.  however i need to find a place for the brush picker
- laid groundwork so that the tileed window can be the application's sole context, for editing a VSP without a map loaded.

- tweaked click region for layer control, to Select For Write, user just clicks anywhere east of the icons
- tweaked layer control painting. now highlights currently selected layer
- squished the sidebar a little more.  it just about fits in 1024x768 now.
- fixed another bug with vsp controller scroll calculation
- sidebar is now 'disabled' until a map is loaded.
- renamed some menus again
- fixed bug where tile 0 was not being drawn on the bottom layer
- fixed problem where (sometimes) editing zones using the sidebar button wouldn't actually save the changes
- fixed various edit tools that weren't 'touch'ing the map after editing the data, to ensure the user Saves
