The Curse of Dragmoria - A Tropical Adventure!

An entry for 168 HoV contest, 11 April 2004.

This little game was built upon the V3 demo of Sully Chronicles (made by Vecna), 
and contains some elements from it. Most of our own code is in system.vc and tropic.vc. 
We made a minor addition to v1_rpg.vc.

This is our first compo entry ever; with this game we wanted to learn to use the new V3 
tools. This makes the conversion of our main project to V3 easier in the future. 95% of 
the material is completely new, made during the compo. Only one speech portrait, some 
code and few sound files were taken from our main project. The result is a simple and 
short quest where you have to collect some items to complete the game. Most of our time 
went to making the Trefus Island map, so there wasn't much time left for gameplay elements.
