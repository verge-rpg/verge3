 - Map/Entity/CHR system.
 - Map VC system implemented.
 - Issue with Random seeding has been corrected.
 - Tools and stuff released. 

========================================
02/22/04 
 - Mikmod out. FMOD in. Music API restructured.
   There is now a "simple music" API and an advanced
   music API, which is needed to do things like
   crossfading, pausing, and manipulation of music position.
   Both APIs fully support modules, MIDIs and mp3/oggs.
   Sound effects can also be either wav or mp3/ogg.
   (however they are handled differently. sound effects are
   fully loaded into memory; mp3s played as music are streamed)
 - A bug in for() loops was fixed.
 - The "system" font now renders to any image correctly.
 - A few new window management routines were added.
 - Some new string-handling functions. TokenCount() and
   GetToken() will aid with breaking a string apart for 
   purposes of word wrapping for instance. Also added 
   ToUpper() and ToLower().
 - LoadFont no longer takes w/h arguments. The cell size 
   is automatically detected. Its not foolproof however, in 
   cases where the autodetection fails, you can still use the
   original loader that takes width/height, now named 
   LoadFontEx.
 - Joystick variables are now activated.
 - Miscellaneous new VC commands: FontHeight(), MixColor(),
   and chr().
 - Fixed a bug involving string arrays causing problems with
   all strings declared after it by not updating the offsets
   correctly.
 - Fixed a bizarre bug with launching v3 from Textpad :o
 - Using %s or other %codes in VC strings wont screw stuff
   up anymore.
 - Added lastkey; returns the last key pressed as an ASCII
   character
 - Eagle/2xSAI has been removed until such time as we get around
   to fixing it and putting it back in or giving a care about it
   in general
 - Preliminary AVI playback is in. There are still some bugs
   and quirks that we are working out. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
   that you use only simple codecs like intels Indeo and not
   DIVX/XVID due to codec compatibility issues. Unless you 
   plan to make an installer and include the codecs your 
   game uses. ^_^
