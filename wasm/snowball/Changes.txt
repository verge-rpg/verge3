ustor - Jan. 5, 2006
====================
- NOTE: All this fussing over formatting, honestly.
- FIX: Homing_Cling AI will no longer leap off of edges at the player and will instead stop at the offending edge and wait patiently until the player moves elsewhere.
- ADD: boy.chr and girl.chr both have and IDLE animation state.
- CHANGE: Relocated the core switch() statement to ai.vc. It makes more sense to have this part here, near all of the called functions.
- ADD: A Coward AI type has been added. Rather than recycling StalkPlayer(), AvoidPlayer() was created new. It should lend more flexibility later.

Overkill - Jan. 5, 2006
=======================
- FIX: FileWriteEnemies() and FileReadEnemies() weren't properly storing visibility information
- CHANGE: Cling AI is *less* stupid now, so it can walk down the small slopes. The steep ones, however still pose a problem.

ustor - Jan. 4, 2006

- ADD: Added two new AI types: Cling and Homing.

ustor - Jan. 3, 2006
====================
- ADD: Added InitializeLevelInfo() to autoexec() in system.vc. This is a temporary solution to having level specific information.

- ADD: levelselect.vc is created and stuff is added. See it for more, if necessary.
- ADD: hudinterface.vc is created. Contains fucntions to render gameplay interface.
- CHANGE: Moved two #defines (MAX_SNOWBALLS + MAX_PLAYER_SNOWBALLS) to hudinterface.vc to prevent issues with the #include ordering.
- CHANGE: Extracted DrawHealthBar() from platform.vc and placed it in hudinterface.vc, called from the new DrawHUDInterface(), the master interface render function.
- ADD: All HUD draw functions perform correctly, but still require some visual jazz.
- FIX: Re-established Changes.txt. Lets try to keep it updated shall we!
