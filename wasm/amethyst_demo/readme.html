<p><b>About This Demo:</b>
<br>First of all, thank you for downloading and playing this demo.
<br>This game is the reason I got into game development and found <a href="http://www.verge-rpg.com">Verge</a> all those
years ago. This is the 4th, and final, incarnation of this game as I have scratched it and rebuilt it time and time again
using various different engines. All the while building the skills required to make a decent indie-game.
It has been a long and incredibly rewarding journey that has helped me to improve my skill in a variety of areas. When I look back at the
original V1 version of it, it is quite amazing to see how far I have come, but I suppose that that is the same for many of us.
<br>That being said, I finally feel as though I can tell the story and introduce the characters that I have been developing for quite some time,
in the way that I have wanted to all along.
<br>
I by no means consider the game play to be original. It is a typical FF-style console RPG and my main concern has always been the story and music, but
hopefully you'll enjoy a the familiar system while reading a fun story and getting to know the characters.
<br>
The demo contains around 30 minutes of game play (give or take a few) and shows a 90% completed menu system, and 90% completed battle system. Both can
and will be polished in certain areas, but for the most part the backbone to the engine is complete.
<br>
A lot of graphics are ripped and altered, but I figured meh. This is my *hobby* so, I don't really care. :P Graphics that weren't
are credited to the author(s).
<br>
The music is *all* original. Enjoy!
<br>At the end of the demo a credit roll plays which you can skip by pressing [ENTER] that will take you to a "To Be Continued" screen which you can
also skip by pressing [ENTER]. It will then ask you if you want to save. My intentions are to keep save games compatible so that you won't have to
redo certain parts of the demo once the next bit of story is released.
<br>On a final note, there is a "Special Thanks" part at the end of the credits but there are a few people who deserve much more mention as they have
helped me, pondered ideas with me, or just listened to me babble on about this game for the last few years. Though "RysenSoft" has pretty well become
a one man show, these people have helped form this game in a variety of ways. A lot of these people I have lost contact with
but I still want to acknowledge them any way:
<br>
<br><b>Ryan Anderson</b> (The Ry in Rysen; My original partner in crime.)
<br><b>Aaron Cannon</b> (Another former member)
<br><b>Greg Phillips</b> (Endless nights of talking about ideas and creator of the Amethyst logo)
<br><b>Jessica Yeandle-Hignell</b> (One of the most talented artists I have ever met. Thank you for the original portraits, and character designs)
<br><b>Chris Oyler</b> (Consistent feedback and help in all aspects of art.)
<br><b>zaril</b> (The man who introduced me to the awesome world of tracking)
<br><b>Troupe</b> (Original HoV buddy and Amethyst enthusiast)
<br><b>RageCage</b> (Another original HoV buddy)
<br><b>Swordsman</b> (Constant coding help, and original HoV buddy)
<br><b>Quanta</b> (Story help and ideas. You are truly gifted my friend.)
<br><b>Khross</b> (Constant constructive, and great criticism while giving me reasons to compose more music.)
<br>I <3 you all!

<p>With that out of the way, I present Amethyst!

<p><b>Introduction:</b><br>
It is a dark time for the land of Redalia.
<br>4 years have passed since this once thriving
Kingdom fell to the ever expanding empire of Argonia, and the birth of the Redalian Resistance Faction
lead by former Princess Nicole Redalias, herself.
<br>Among those few with enough will to continue the good fight is Charity, a young female and former
student of Magic at the prestigious Redalian Academy. When Charity and a few other Faction members plan
a heist to gain food for their camp, she's is reunited with an old friend long thought dead when things
go horribly wrong. To make matters worse, the caravan was carrying something of much more importance than
just food. <br>
Something the Argonians would rather keep a secret...
<br>What starts out as a noble quest to retain the beautiful lands of Redalia takes our heroes
on a journey that will test their courage and skill much more than any one had ever anticipated for the outcome
not only affects Redalia, but the entire world.

<p>
<b>Basic Controls:</b>
<br>[ARROW KEYS]: Move player and pointers, where applicable
<br>[ENTER]: Confirm/Action Key
<br>[ALT]: Cancel
<br>[SPACE BAR]: Brings up the "Description Bar", where available
<br>[ESC]: Opens the Menu, where available
<br>[ALT+X]: Exits the game without prompting

<p>
<b>The Learn Magic System:</b>
<br>The Learn Magic system is kind of a cross between FFIX and FFX-2. Each character can pick and choose which
spell or skill they want to learn next. A character has a "Learn Level" with four options to choose from. Once
all four spells have been learned for a "Learn Level" four new ones become available.
<br>To learn spells and skills a character must acquire AP which is gained at the end of a battle. In order to use a spell or skill
a character must have either mastered it or is currently learning it. You can set which spell a character is to learn in the "Learn"
sub-menu of the menu system.
<br>The Learn Magic system is under construction at the moment. On paper it seemed like a neat idea, but after actually putting
it in and testing it, it was obvious that some changes need to be made. From my testing it appears to be rediculously easy to learn
spells. If they were in, it probably wouldn't take long to get to level 4 which is where all the best spells are. I've left it as is
for the demo but it will be changed by the next release. I'll probably add a level cap or something so that you can only learn magic from
the next magic level once you reach a certain player level.

<p>
<b>Class Skills:</b>
<br>Each character belongs to a certain class, and as such have a special skill that they can use which requires no learning or MP. The ones
introduced in the demo are:
<br><b>Cover:</b> Character takes a blow for another party members with low HP (Currently NOT implemented)
<br><b>Focus:</b> Temporarily raises a characters magic stat for the duration of a battle
<br><b>Pray:</b> Restores a little amount of HP to all characters

<p>That's basically it for things that are not constantly found in a console RPG. There is an in-game tutorial right after the opening
scene where you can read more if you're unsure about anything.

<p><b>Known Issues:</b>
<br>The only major bug that I know of is that it likes to some times crash at the end of the demo right before loading the "Save" menu after the credit role.
I have yet to have a problem with this, so I'm not really sure what's wrong at this point. So if anyone gets this and has an idea of what's causing it please let me know.

As well there have been a few suggestions made by Gannon who was a great source of help in testing that I plan on attending to in later releases:
<Ul>
<LI>Replace specific keys with generic ones (Ie. Instead of [Enter] use [Action])
<LI>Add config menu to the title screen
<LI>Empty treasure chests should indicate as such in the beginning.
<LI>Explain what "Amera" is.
<LI>People should haved different conversations after you've talked to them
<LI>Explain status effects in more detail.
<LI>Have a scene to tie the two events together.
<LI>In battle the remembering of choices should be seperate for each party member
<LI>Update spell so that when one is learned it automatically searches for the next one to  learn.
<LI>should try to make sure that you can alway go some steps before getting into anouther random battle after a random battle
<LI>Make item drops based on LUC instead of just random (or lower the chance)
<LI>Make it so the cell doors don't reset in Allowen
<li>Fix targeting in battle (Ie. Where the spells/pointer, etc. appear)
<li>Fix Wraptext
<li>pressing confirm alot when using pray with sara makes her go off the left of the screen
 (This is probably true for all the class skills)
</ul>
<p><b>Things to Come:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Running in Battle
	<li>More Status Effects
	<li>More fancy animations
	<li>More story
	<li>More music
	<li>Shop system
	<li>Better damage algorithms
	<li>That's all I can think of at the moment
</ul>

Feel free to use anything that may help you. All I ask is that music is not used without permission. Everything else (code, art, etc.)
is yours to do with what you will. Though credit is not expected it most certainly would be appreciated. :)
