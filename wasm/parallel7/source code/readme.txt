This is the source code for our beloved HOV  project. In  it  you'll  find
examples of menu systems, textboxes, savegame scripts,  graphical  effects
and the like. Feel free to "borrow" some of it for your  games.  Crediting
me (Interference) is encouraged but entirely optional.

DO NOT steal anything from the script or  story.  This  is  punisheable by
DEATH. Equally, passing off my art as your own from the game  will  result
in me hunting you down and systematically hacking off your extremities.

If you have Textpad, you can view the source's project file, which is  the
way it was intended to be viewed. A resolution of 1024x768  or  higher  is
preferred for viewing but not overly necessary.

So, have fun.

That is all.
