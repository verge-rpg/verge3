<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Good *God*, 
  is it that time already? It's something-o'clock. Can't tell. Too tired. Whaever 
  it is, it has an &quot;am&quot; in it so that must be bad. Living in England, 
  the HOV competition ended at 5am and I made the most of the time. My fingers 
  now WOBBLE when I try to touch things.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zip (the guy 
  you can thank for the battle system) and I have been working tirelessly to throw 
  our little contribution together in some playable form so you can actually get 
  a go on what we've been whittling away at for the past fortnight.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to <em>Parallel 
  </em>7. It's a Sci-fi horror RPG but the horror doesn't really hit until towards 
  the end of this sadly unfinished entry (I <strong>do</strong> plan to do some 
  work on it post-HOV, so you may well see it finished in the not-so-distant future). 
  The battle system works, the menu systems function as they should but the plot 
  - as you may notice while playing - will stop abruptly. This is where *I* stopped 
  abruptly and submitted. Time, eh? There's never enough of it. Or productivity, 
  for that matter.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The game litterally 
  sticks you in the boots of Hugo Zane, failed bounty hunter extraordinaire, as 
  he's dragged around a passenger liner by a woman with nice hair. You also get 
  to hit people and things, which is a bonus in my book, which happens to be a 
  battered copy of <em>Fight Club</em>, in which hitting people features prevelantly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sorry, where 
  was I? Yes: game. You play. You like. Game make happy happy. Tarzan like Jane. 
  Or something.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Comments and 
  questions are heavily encouraged (<a href="mailto:interference22@hotmail.com">interference22@hotmail.com</a> 
  or v-rpg.com's hallowed message boards) since a whole lot of time was spent 
  on this and - while not half what I wanted it to finally look like - is still 
  something I'm fairly proud of as a first HOV attempt. The dialogue, art and 
  code is all original. Feel free to steal the code. Troupe made some of the music 
  (the .OXMs in the music directory, like the title theme) so that is also fairly 
  nice to experience.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yes, a VERGE 
  keyboard button. I press and BANG! Up comes my VERGE directory.<br>
  Hardcore? <em>I think so</em>.</font></p>
