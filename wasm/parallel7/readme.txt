+----------------------------+

Parallel Seven is Team Ultimate Disco Monkey's entry into the summer HOV.
We are:

  Fred: "Interference" Burbidge  (Coder,  artist,  scriptwriter,  project
        lead etc.)
   Zip: (Battle system coder)

Controls are as follows:

Arrow Keys: Move around
Esc: Access the menus
Enter: Use / Examine / Equip / Confirm / Select / Talk etc.

Most objects in-game are either useable or have a description. Try using
pretty much everything.

Recieved items will appear in your inventory. Wearable items and weapons
can be equipped from your inventory screen. An item in yellow  indicates
it is equipped. To equip an item, select it and hit enter.  To  unequip,
do the same. Equipping an item on a body part that already has one  will
unequip the old and equip the new.

Standard items can be used from the inventory screen by  selecting  them
and pressing enter. The list of items you have is scrollable,  so if you
don't see an item you DEFINETLY picked up then keep pressing down  until
the list scrolls to see it.

Press left or right to  flip  through  members  of  your  party  in  the
inventory and status screens to equip items and view statistics in turn.

One other thing to note - if you feel like poking around with the game's
resources: the file credits.txt is loaded by the  game  to  display  the
credits. Please don't mess with it.

Parallel Seven is a Sci-Fi Horror RPG, influenced  by  a  Dr  Who  story
called "Terror of the Vervoids," playing far too much of  System Shock 2
and life in general. Enjoy.

That is all.
