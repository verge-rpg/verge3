While the spr_*.vcs are pretty self explanitory, as are the lenses (well, le_* means
lens effect, while lm_* means lens movement), the bgr*.vc naming convention is not
immediately obvious.

Firstly, bgr<number>.vc denotes a Base Level Effect. This means that whatever the 
background image consisted of before, after the Base Level Effect executes, it will
be completely different, every pixel will be changed. This would be something like
a tiled background that covers everything, or a gradient pattern, or even a simple
fade-to-black.

bgr<letter>.vc denotes a Top Level Effect, or a modifier. This will leave portions
of the base level effect visible, and for example might be the shadebob things, or
some crazy eyeballs plastered on the background.

There are some files named bgr<number><letter>.vc. For instance, there might be
bgr4.vc and bgr4a.vc. This implies that bgr4a MIGHT be executed immediatley after 
bgr4 (there's a higher chance of going directly to bgr4a than of going to a new
random base level effect). In otherwords its basically a top level effect, but one
specifically paired with that base effect.

Here's a rundown of the actual effects so far.

bgr.vc		- master background effects file

Base Level Effects

bgr0.vc		- Looping gradient drawn out from the center
bgr1.vc		- Tiled 32x32 patterns blitted individually to the background
bgr2.vc		- Crossfade to a 32x32 tiled pattern
bgr3.vc		- Colored spheres expand and eventually fill entire screen
bgr4.vc		- Cross-hatched looping gradients
bgr5.vc		- Evilgradient!
bgr6.vc		- Fade to black for certain effects
bgr6a.vc	- Creepy Faces
bgr6b.vc	- Spheres

Top Level Effects

bgrb.vc		- Shadebobs
bgrc.vc		- Flowers
