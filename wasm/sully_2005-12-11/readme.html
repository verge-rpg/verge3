	<p><font color=red>Note: This release has incomplete docs.  They will be completed in short order, but it's good enough for the time being... and if anyone wants to help with the documentation, well, I won't begrudge that. ;) -Grue</font></p>
	<p>Welcome to VERGE 3, a versitile game-creation system designed to be powerful and easy to learn.</p>
	<p>If you are new here, please play the packin game.  Just run VERGE.EXE in this very same <a href=./>directory</a>.</p>
	<p>If you are looking for the documentation, you can find it in <a href=./docs/index.html>[the documentation folder]</a>.  <a href=./docs/tutorial/index.html>[Rysen's tutorial]</a> is a very good place to start.</p>
	<p>If you need help after that, try asking for some on the <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/>[VERGE-RPG message Boards]</a>, or you can email me at <a href=mailto:mcgrue@verge-rpg.com?subject=I+need+help+with+VERGE+3,+please.>mcgrue@verge-rpg.com</a> or message me via AIM (screenname: astradian).</p>
