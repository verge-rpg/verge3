VERGE License
===========================================================================

1) 
VERGE is provided for free use without warranty to anyone creating 
products with it for non-profit use.

It is suggested, but not required, that any freeware game or application 
have a startup sequence proclaiming something along the lines of "made with
VERGE 3" and providing a URL to the official verge homepage.  
We won't force you, though.

However, links and credits should be left in all of your readmes, 
documentation, and credits. The existance of a Readme file of some kind is
required, if only to proclaim that this was made using VERGE.

These requirements may be waived with permission from the author.

2) 
For all other uses of VERGE (ie, anything commercial), please contact
the author.
