<h1>Welcome to the Sully API!</h1>
<p>This doc totally sucks.  I've been working on it too long. ;_;</p>
<p>All the source has a large amount of input/output/error-type comments above each function.  If anyone wants to help me find a good comments-to-pretty-docs thingy that would be swell :(</p>
<p>for now, just click on the library you want to see.</p>
