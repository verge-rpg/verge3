<h1>The utility libraries</h1>
<p>Theses are all fairly standalone.  Use them with love and for great justice.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Targetting Library</b><br/>This is a bunch of stuff to aid correctly seeding all the targets of an effect (be it a spell effect or an item effect or whatever), to properly send them to their resolution.<br/><br/></li>
	<li><b>Inet Talk</b><br/>A very limited-use set of specific functions to demo some remedial web functionality.<br/><br/></li>
	<li><b>Icons</b><br/>Just a polite little interface to ye olde icons!<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
