Setting up Textpad for Verge</u></b></center>

<p><b>Why use Textpad?</b><br>
Textpad is a great text
editor for programming, and has a few features that are very appealing. First
would be what is known as "syntax highlighting". What this means is that once
you set it up (which I will explain in a moment) when you write code in Verge3
it will appear in different colours that will help you recognize different
aspects of your code. Such as comments, functions, built-in functions/variables
and other characters found in VC. This is handy as it can help you to find
errors, as well as let you know if the function name you just typed in is
correct.<br>
Another feature is the ability to use "Workspaces". This allows you to have
multiple files of code open, all organized into one window so that you don't
have to keep switching between opened documents.
<p>
<b>Where can I get
textpad?<br>
</b>You can download from the official site <a href="http://www.textpad.com/">http://www.textpad.com/</a><br>
Although it is "shareware", textpad is fully functional without any
restrictions or a time limit of how long you can use it for. The only
difference between the shareware version and the registered version is that it
will remind you once in awhile that you are not using a registered version.

<p><b>Installing and
setting up Syntax highlighting:</b><br>

<ul><li>
First things first, you
must download the VC3 syntax file that I created from the official verge
site,<a
href="http://www.verge-rpg.com/files/detail.php?id=371">here.</a><br>

<li>It will be in a zip
file, so extract it to the "System" folder found in the directory you installed
Textpad to.</li>

<li>Next, open textpad and
go to "Configure" then choose "New Document Class".
<li>A window should appear with the text: Document Class Name, and a box beside it.
Type in "VC" and click next.</li>

<li>On the next screen, in
the box beside "Class Members", type "*.vc" (without the quotes, so, asterisk
dot vc), then click next.</li>

<li>On the next screen
click the box that says “Enable syntax Highlighting” and then in the drop down menu
look for “vc3.syn”. Click next.</li>

<li>On the next screen
double-check and make sure everything is correct, and then click Finish.</li></ul>

<p>You may have to restart
the program for it to take affect, however, now whenever you open a .vc file
with textpad, you will see a bunch of different colours, which will help you to
distinguish the different parts of your code.

<p><b>Workspaces:<br>
</b>Workspaces are very useful in that they allow you to have multiple
documents open in one window as opposed to having a bunch of tabs at the bottom
of your screen. If you have multiple .vc files (either map or function) you can
open them all and save them as a workspace by choosing "Workspaces" then
"save" from the File menu. <br>
Call it whatever you like, which will create a file called "yourname.tws", and
then the next time you go to work on your project all you need to do is double
click that file. Textpad will open and load all the documents you saved in the
workspace.
