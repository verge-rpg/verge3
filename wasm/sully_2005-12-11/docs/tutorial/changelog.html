<p>Change Log:

	<ul>
	<li>Octoboer.7th/2004</li>
	<li>I'm just letting people know that it may be awhile before the next update. I'm scheduled to write
	a "Creating a Basic Menu" section, however, McGrue has asked me if I could create a "Learning from Sully" (the verge pack-in demo)
	section, so that's where we'll learn how to do most of (if not all) the intermediate stuff we were going to be getting into. I'm just
	reviewing the code now, and trying my best to figure out where to start. The great thing about Sully is that for the most part is a
	complete RPG library (I believe the only thing lacking is a Battle System), so most aspects that are needed for an RPG are all ready
	coded and finished. So! I'm making a call to those of you who use this tutorial, what would you like to start with? There are many
	parts of a game that we can begin with, forming a party, creating the menu, databases (item/equip/magic systems), etc. etc. So if there
	are any requests for a particular part of an RPG that you would like to learn feel free to <a href=maitlo:rysen@actionsketch.com>E-mail me</a>
	with suggestions. If not, I'll try and think of what is the easiest thing to introduce first, and go from there.
	</li>
	<li>October.4th/2004</li>
	<li>I decided to add a change log to the index, just so when this is updated you can tell what's
		new, etc.
		<br>For today's update it was mostly just spelling/grammer fixes. Nothing significant.</br>
