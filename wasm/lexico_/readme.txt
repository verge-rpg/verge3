1. TIME SPENT

Not too much time before the extension, and then the entire week after the extension. 
Writing this an hour before it's due so I'll be brief.
===========================================
2. STORY

Er.. it's covered later in the game. PLAY IT.
===========================================
3. CONTROLS

W = Move Player/Camera Up
A = Move Player/Camera Left 
S = Move Player/Camera Down
D = Move Player/Camera Right

ESC = Bring up menu
SPACE = Interact with objects
LEFT-CLICK = Activate a button on-screen
RIGHT-CLICK = Define a symbol if the mouse is over one
===========================================
4. GAMEPLAY TIPS

- It's VITAL to define a new symbol when you think you know what it means. Right-click
on the symbol and type in your definition, then hit enter. If you mouse over the symbol,
you'll see the definition you put in. A symbol you have previously defined will appear
green on the GUI.

- The menu is useful too. It includes a map, a list of defined symbols, save, load, and
quit functions. Use it well.

- Solving puzzles will require pieces of knowledges from all over the game area. Explore
everything and, most importantly, push all buttons to see what they do in order to
figure out what symbols mean.

- Use your brain, and ingenuity. This game is really hard, so try your best. Please don't
cheat. Figuring everything out yourself will make you feel good, we promise.
