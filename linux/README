This is a GNU/Linux build of http://github.com/Bananattack/verge3

To compile, just cd to src directory and run make.
Make sure to edit the Makefile and make sure that you are using the sdl-config
for SDL-1.3.

Dependencies: libpng, corona, zlib, lua-5.1, audiere, giflib, gtk2, SDL-1.3

You only need the verge/Source/ and linux/ directories, the rest is unused.

Current status:
-Compiles OK (with a bunch of warnings).
-Need to tackle the problem with Windows' path  delimiter '\' in resource files.
-Need to specify namespaces in Lua scripts (v3 for verge).

Changes:
-Switched to Audiere
-Copied threads.h from Audiere tree under verge/Source/
-Check for nil pointer before using it (snd_audiere.h)
